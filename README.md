Introduction to Systems

What is system?
-----------

Video:
[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fxGZ7GRQMsk/maxresdefault1.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxGZ7GRQMsk)

Description:
In this Video, he described the system as a source which manipulates the given input signal. With a system we can perform many operations on input signals and get the desired output.
He also mentioned the types 0f systems which are continuous and discrete systems. And then he discusses them.

Description:

Memoryless system: The system is said to be memoryless (in both continuous-time and discrete-time) if its output signal only depends on the present value of the input signal.
The input from the past and future has no influence on the output of the system.

Ex: A resistor is memoryless, since the current i(t) flowing through it in response to the applied voltage v(t) is defined by


     
where R is resistance of the resistor.
